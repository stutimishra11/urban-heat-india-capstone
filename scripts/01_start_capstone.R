# Author: Stuti Mishra

# This script will be used to:
# - load MODIS MOD11C3 land surface temperature data
# - inspect variables and units
# - convert temperature values from scaled Kelvin to Celsius
# - prepare data for spatial and temporal analysis

# Code will be added as preprocessing progresses
